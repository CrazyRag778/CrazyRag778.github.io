                    Well! Let me be clear - I’m writing this blog only because git ignores blank directories and I also need to test the blog site with some articles, oh sorry, “an” article. So, this post is not going to be long. But there are some things that I need to tell you guys. I don’t write blogs that often, and nor do I write blogs because I need to share my day with you. *Warning - RSS Feed is not available for my blog, because it may contain code that RSS Viewers are not able to render.
                    <br><br>
                    Oops! I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Nobody. Sorry, joking. I’m CrazyRag778. If you have a bit of common sense, you already might have figured out that it is indeed my alias. There is nothing interesting about me. So, coming forward towards the point, I just made this website because, A website is a necessity nowadays, right? And I also need a place where I can post content my way. 
                    <br><br>
                    So, as I’ve mentioned earlier, RSS isn’t available for my blog. Web Scraping might be the only possible alternative if you don’t wanna read my blogs from my website. I will make a solution to this problem later. But for now on, please try reading it through my website.
